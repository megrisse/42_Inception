## WordPress LEMP Stack with Docker

This project demonstrates a lightweight WordPress system built on the LEMP stack (Nginx, MariaDB, PHP) using Docker and Docker Compose. It serves as a practical learning environment to gain experience with system administration using Docker.

# Features:

Simplified Setup: Leverages Docker Compose to streamline the configuration and deployment of the LEMP stack components (Nginx, MariaDB, PHP) and WordPress.
Customizable: Easily modify environment variables in .env to tailor settings for your WordPress installation.
Scalable: Docker's containerization approach allows for scaling the number of WordPress instances or other services as needed.
Portable: Docker ensures consistent development and deployment environments across different machines.
Requirements:

Docker Engine (install instructions: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
Docker Compose (install instructions: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
Getting Started:

Clone the Repository:

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/megrisse/42_Inception.git
cd 42_Inception
```
Create .env File:

Copy the .env.example file to .env.
Update environment variables in .env according to your needs (e.g., database name, password).
Build and Run:

```Bash
docker-compose up -d
```
-d flag runs the containers in detached mode.
Accessing WordPress:

By default, WordPress will be accessible at http://localhost:8080.
Update the VIRTUAL_HOST environment variable in .env for custom domain access.
Navigate to the URL in your browser to complete the WordPress installation process.
Additional Notes:

Database Access: Use a tool like phpMyAdmin (https://www.phpmyadmin.net/downloads/) to access the MariaDB database (credentials stored in .env).
Persistent Volumes (Optional): Consider using Docker volumes to persist WordPress data beyond container restarts (refer to Docker documentation for details: https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/).
Security:

This setup is intended for development purposes. For production environments, implement additional security measures (firewalls, proper user permissions, etc.).
Always keep Docker and Docker Compose updated.
